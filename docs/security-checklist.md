# Security Checklist for AI Development

## Pre-Development Security Check

### âœ… Environment Variables
- [ ] `.env` files are in `.gitignore`
- [ ] `.env.example` exists with dummy values
- [ ] No real secrets in version control
- [ ] Environment variables are properly validated

### âœ… AI Tool Security
- [ ] `ai.config.yaml` is configured
- [ ] `.cursorignore` excludes sensitive files
- [ ] All AI tool directories are in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Security policies are active for all AI tools

### âœ… Code Security
- [ ] No `eval()` or `new Function()` usage
- [ ] No `child_process` or `exec()` calls
- [ ] No direct access to `process.env.SECRET`
- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] Output sanitization implemented

## During Development

### âœ… Before Each Commit
- [ ] No sensitive data in commit messages
- [ ] No API keys or passwords in code
- [ ] All environment variables are externalized
- [ ] Security policies are not bypassed

### âœ… Code Review
- [ ] Check for dangerous patterns
- [ ] Verify input validation
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling
- [ ] Review authentication logic

## Post-Development

### âœ… Deployment Security
- [ ] Environment variables set in production
- [ ] No secrets in build artifacts
- [ ] HTTPS enabled
- [ ] Security headers configured

### âœ… Monitoring
- [ ] Security logs enabled
- [ ] Error tracking configured
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] Regular security audits scheduled

## Emergency Procedures

### ðŸš¨ If Security Breach Suspected
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - [ ] Revoke all API keys
   - [ ] Change database passwords
   - [ ] Rotate environment variables
   - [ ] Check access logs

2. **Investigation**:
   - [ ] Review recent commits
   - [ ] Check AI tool logs
   - [ ] Audit environment variables
   - [ ] Scan for exposed secrets

3. **Recovery**:
   - [ ] Restore from secure backup
   - [ ] Update security policies
   - [ ] Document incident
   - [ ] Implement additional safeguards

## Security Tools Integration

- [ ] Dependency vulnerability checks
- [ ] Code quality gates
- [ ] Security policy enforcement

## Team Security Training

### âœ… Required Knowledge
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- [ ] Secure coding practices
- [ ] AI tool security risks
