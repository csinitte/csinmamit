# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue
The Vercel deployment was failing with the following errors:
1. "ESLint must be installed in order to run during builds"
2. Type error in `.eslintrc.cjs`: "Cannot find module 'eslint' or its corresponding type declarations"

## Root Cause
The project had `"type": "module"` in package.json (ES modules), but the ESLint configuration was using CommonJS format (`.eslintrc.cjs`) with a TypeScript type annotation that couldn't be resolved during the build process.

## Solution Applied
1. **Converted `.eslintrc.cjs` to `.eslintrc.json`**: Removed the TypeScript type annotation and module.exports syntax by converting to JSON format
2. **Updated `tsconfig.json`**: Removed `.eslintrc.cjs` from the include array
3. **Verified dependencies**: Confirmed ESLint was already installed in devDependencies

## Changes Made
- Deleted: `.eslintrc.cjs`
- Created: `.eslintrc.json` with the same configuration in JSON format
- Modified: `tsconfig.json` to remove `.eslintrc.cjs` from the include array

## Build Test Result
âœ… Local build completed successfully:
- Linting and type checking passed
- All 14 pages generated successfully
- No errors encountered

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to your repository
2. Push to trigger a new Vercel deployment
3. The deployment should now succeed without the ESLint errors

## Commands to Deploy
```bash
git add .eslintrc.json tsconfig.json
git rm .eslintrc.cjs
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment: Convert ESLint config to JSON format"
git push origin master
